# text2text_project
Basic messaging website that allows sending messages to other users, real-time chatting. It uses Node js for server-side processing, specifically, authenticating, navigating, or updating chat logs.

The website is deployed on a free-hosting server: https://satin-nebula-archaeology.glitch.me/
Creating a new account is not available yet, a sample account in use is: { ID: 000005; pass: pe123456; }

There are still bugs with sending messages too quickly though :<
